# AWS Terraform Modules

This repository contains information and documentation related to AWS Terraform modules. Each module will have a dedicated folder, which includes a `README.md` file for detailed documentation.

## Standard Practices

We adhere to standard best practices for creating AWS Terraform modules. The modules are designed to be loosely coupled, enabling their use in various use cases. 

## Key Features of the Modules

1. Modular and reusable design.
2. Use of Terraform functions such as `for`, `count`, `when`, `local`, `data`, etc.
3. Flexibility to adapt to diverse use cases and requirements.

By following these principles, the modules ensure maintainability, scalability, and ease of integration into different projects.
